You cant call passwordgenerator directly as too many rerenders to prevent infinite loop 
Cause there is a callback what if there is no callback

Important note that if you use callback you try to optimize the method whereas in useEffect you check if any updation is there then corresponding changes occur

COPY Button 
In this you have two entities which are not connected to each other input and copy button so you can connect them using the useRef hook 

How to use this

jiska ref lena h uske attribute mai ref={name} daaldo

IMPORTANT
When we do this on next.js there is no window object on server side
