#INTRO
server is a software which serves anything

Framework 
certain rules set are meant to be followed jo hai so hai 
you cant just use as your wish

Libraries can be used as per users wish
Freedom h hence react is a library

React makes single page application

Use manipulation 
Add on like React router


#Create React Projects

Use documentations to understand but the react one is not too beginner friendly 
Vite and Parcel are bundlers which take various js files and gives a single file jisse saara kaam hojata hai

React ke saath do libraries milte hai
1.React-DOM : Website se kaam hai only
2.React-native: Mobile apps ke liye yeh more imp and Dom is thoda bht imp
(three.js ki bhi alag library aayegi)

Difference between npx and npm ki npx mai directly execute karna chahte hai rather than adding and executing in the system

create-react-app is a UTILITY 

npx create-react-app 01basicreact to run the react file but this method is too time taking 

To understand the react project head to the JSON file 
1.Dependencies:React and react-dom are present 
2.Testing libraries are also given
3.React scripts
4.Web vitals are for performance
Some imp scripts
1.start to run it in the environment
2.build is used when production mai jab jaata h cause browser simple html react hi samjhta hai to use kaise kare?
3.test is for test cases
4.eject is to remove the project from react and rest is done in some other library or framework

lintConfig is ki jo error aata h wo underline or some lines which could be made better

browser list contains which browsers iam gonna use and which not 

#HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
start script se chalega project

(using npm start has some exception)
npm run start

npm build(build folder hi share hota h rather than some other folder)

But source code mai kuch nahi dikhta just one div with id root

USE VITE

isme project file mai NODE_MODULES Folder nahi hota hai
Understand package.JSON
devDependencies mai wo ho to koi dikkat nahi aur na ho to bhi 
As node modules nahi ho npm i  (i for install)  idhar bhi jo Dependencies download krni hai wo aajeygi

Dono packages mai script mai pehli wali ho rhi use run karne ke liye


#LEARNING NEW THING
README.md file ko update karte hai baar baar

src folder mai har time(but build folder in production)

Deleting some Files and Folders
reportWebVitals
logo.svg
setupTests.js
apptests.js
app.css

only three files app.js 
index.js index.css(can remove this though)


Removed Comments and unnecessary lines
