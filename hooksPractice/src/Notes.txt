//Jitni baar state change hogi component re render hoga 
Use memo 
this works when props changes only 

When you add another function in the prop which returns something then everytime you click and the function returns something each return is different from other and hence memo would not work here

const getAdjective=()=>{
    console.log("This is me")
} 
const getAdjective2=()=>{
    console.log("This is me")
} 

getAdjective!= getAdjective2 though both are same so this means that every call is treated differently and hence rendered everytime meaning prop has been changed so it will print

How do you avoid this??
Kindof yaad rakho ki aisa baar baar call na karo

useCallback se freeze hojayga so no worries of re-rendering

What if we use count in the callback which means har baar alag value so har baar re-rendering karna padega

Agar bina callback ke karenge to navbar rerender hoga as function change ho rha 

Use callback use karoge to bhi wo freeze hojayega

Isme dependency daaloge matlab jab tak wo dependency change nahi hogi use lock kardo and change mat karo
