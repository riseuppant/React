Here, in this module we will try to understand how React is inserted into HTML
and Javascript ko kuch bhi kaam ke liye html mai inject 

Package.json ki saari Dependencies node_modules folder mai present hoti hai

Package-lock.json basically usme sab Dependencies ke stable versions lock hojaate hai

Public Folder mai 
mainfest for mobile versions ke liye meta tags dekhe jaate hai
Single page index.html load hota hai

index.html
mai noscript tag which sends a message to enable the script for the browser

then div id root and which is empty 
nor there is no js injected 

src mai main entry index.js (can be changed )
ek root variable hota hai (with two libraries react-core foundational library and reactdom(it is implementation of react on web))

React khudka bhi dom bnata h(VIRTUAL DOM) and then compares from the original dom and works thereby

usme createRoot ek method hota hai 
const root = root ka ref store karta h and then root.render hota hai 
React ka strict mode lo and <App/> ko render kardo

but App ka koi tag nahi hota hai 
feature of JSX rendering elements idhar ek custom tag banate hai 

What is we remove Strict Mode too
(Development specific hota hai for optimization)

App kya hai 
App is a function which returns a HTML and then isko export kardiya and this html ko render karadiya


But isme script tag ko add hi nahi kara hai to wo run kaise ho rahi 
there is a scripts in json which automatically adds the script tag to it

ReactDOM se hi wo element create ho rha 
createRoot expects us to select and html element from index.html


HOW DOES IT HAPPENS IN VITE

There are no scripts in dependencies then how injection of js in html takes place??

Idhar html wali file bahar hai
(not in src)

wo directly hi isme script tag se load kardega

only Difference in the index and main .jsx is that react wala ek var banakar usme ref se ek method run kar rha render 
while on the other hand main.jsx ko directly hi .render kar rhe 

It's a lightweight version 

what we try to do is create a new js file and export that as new element 

But vite mai kuch errors ayenge as usme ek rules hai ki agar components banoge to use jsx mai karna hai


It is advised to put the starting letter of tag in capital as it is the best practice

return (
    <Jimmy/>
    // <h1>Chai aur react</h1>
    // <h2>Chai aur react</h2>
    // <p>test para</p>)
    aisa nahi kar skte ho keval ek time par ONLY ONE COMPONENT hi export kar sakte ho 

What you can either do is sabko ek div mai wrap karo jisse sab ek hi componenet ho jaye
                    (OR)
as writing div was getting problematic use empty closed <> and </> to wrap the whole thing

But But there are some issues 
agar tum react mai ise without caps likh rhe ho tag ko to file run to ho jayegi but jo function wala part h wo bhi append hojayega dom mai but it would remain empty

components ko captials se start rkhe 
jo functions ko export kar rahe ho wo use hi COMPONENTS kehte h 

Good Practice- To name the files in captial too 
You can rename it to JSX too as components are created better to name it to jsx unless you do some JS only
