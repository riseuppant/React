HOOKS in React 

WHYYY???
 <button
    onClick={addValue}
    >Add Value</button>
    <br />

    this is similar where you just use name of the function which means that we pass only the reference of the function 
    what happens is that the funciton is called on click whereas when you write () then the funciton is called without getting clicked

    agar tum () lgaoge then what ever that funciton returns is passed to the handler 
    nahi to uska reference lagao iska  matlab h use point karke rkho and jab marzi hogi tab run karwa dena 


    Now there is an issue that
    counter is not updating though counter is visible but not in the updating
    UI UPDATING ERROR

    Agar ise classical JS se karna ho to har jagah ka refernce lo use decalre karo then update karte jao and which makes task hefty and tidious

    UI Updation ko React Control karta hai


    There is no react import yet the parsing is done as babel does it under the hood 
    
    No need of that variable now 
    as UseState se do chize nikalti hai ek number and ek function jo pure ui mai propogate hoga
