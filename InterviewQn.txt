Abhi agar increament counter mai tum agar addValue 4 baar hoga then what would happen??

const addValue=()=>{
    console.log("Value Added", counter)
    if(counter<20)counter+=1
    setCounter(counter) // idhar 16
    setCounter(counter) 17
    setCounter(counter) 18
    setCounter(counter) 19
    iske baad 20 hoga ya 19?? 
  }
  which means after one clik will the ans be 16/20 ? 
  My ans 20 

Use State batches mai bhejta hai 
Batching Logic is handled by react itself
Batching is a process by which React groups multiple state updates together and applies them in a single re-render 

Batches multiple State updatets
sabhi state counter hi hote hai 

setCounter(counter);
setCounter(counter);
setCounter(counter);
setCounter(counter);


To fix that 
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);

Isme call back hota h jisse counter ki value aati hai current state mai and is passed to that function jab callback hoga to pura implementation rukega
