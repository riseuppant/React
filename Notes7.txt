                                                        Tailwind and Props in React
    Tailwind is a utility 

    dev dependecies production mai nahi jaati mp bundlers etc which are used in development
    These small <> </> are called Fragments

Image <img will give an error 
Here the rule is that every tag added must be a closing tag 
to pehle <img ... > make it as <img ... />

What is the use of Props 
Use of props ki use ek container  mai rakhkar use baar baar use karo
In normal HTML CSS and JS we try to seggreagate on the basis of file

But in react the ideology is like jo componenet bana rhe ho wo ek kaam kare not ki uske andar kya hai 

ek card mai sab html css and js likhdo aur jab tumhe use reuse karna ho tab tum use reuse karo

Matlab ek card ka content pura ek component banao jo ek card return kare

Props ek object hota hai jo empty hota hai use pass karo us component ke params mai


Ab Card mai tum channel lega but with no array nor  object with keys being undeclared
Due to rerenders multiple times it prints
Props: {name: "Hardik"}
Props: {name: "Hardik"}  <-- happens again due to StrictMode
Props: {name: "Hardik"}  <-- maybe re-render from parent
Props: {name: "Hardik"}  <-- final render 

IMPORTANT POINT <Chai classname="Chai"
isme jab tum attributes rkhoge then they are saved as a key value pairs so you have to save it as a variable rather than something object 
here classname is a prop and is added to props object like object mai 
RHS OF prop must be string or a JS expression in {}

React default mai props hi bolta hai 
original syntax props ka kuch aur hota hai 

Cards ke andar username ko use nahi kar rha 
as props is an object 
You can access to username 

either {username} karlo then username use karte raho 

Properties Handle karo 
Default value {btnText || "visitMe"} Readablity issues
