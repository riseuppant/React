                                                        Tailwind and Props in React
    Tailwind is a utility 

    dev dependecies production mai nahi jaati mp bundlers etc which are used in development
    These small <> </> are called Fragments

Image <img will give an error 
Here the rule is that every tag added must be a closing tag 
to pehle <img ... > make it as <img ... />

What is the use of Props 
Use of props ki use ek container  mai rakhkar use baar baar use karo
In normal HTML CSS and JS we try to seggreagate on the basis of file

But in react the ideology is like jo componenet bana rhe ho wo ek kaam kare not ki uske andar kya hai 

ek card mai sab html css and js likhdo aur jab tumhe use reuse karna ho tab tum use reuse karo

Matlab ek card ka content pura ek component banao jo ek card return kare
